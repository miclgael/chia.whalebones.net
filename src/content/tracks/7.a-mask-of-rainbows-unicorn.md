Everyone is invited to be wrong\
To be wrong\
To be wrong

Another time maybe\
Another time maybe

With a mask of rainbows unicorn\
With a mask of rainbows unicorn\
Sweet like sugar\
But gives you stomach cancer

There's noone to carry me\
You can fight it off\
But it will bite you back

Bite you back

Ten years\
Still chasing my shadows

Ten years\
Still chasing my shadows

Ten years\
Still chasing my shadows

Ten years\
Still chasing my shadows
