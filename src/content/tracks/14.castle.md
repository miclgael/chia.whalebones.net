I built you a castle\
And you live beside it\
On your own

Your eyes cannot focus\
It towers so high\
You see the sun\
Before the roof-top\
And your eyes\
Can't adjust to the light\

But if you'd just live with me\
I'd show you everything\
You're a prisoner\
And I am your keeper

I'm an elderly man\
You'll never understand\
The lengths I went

I'm an elderly man\
I'm an elderly man, man
